**virtualecologist** provide facilities to simulate virtual ecosystems,
from the underlying environment to species distribution and scientific
surveys. Species can be simulated with a spatial point process using a
resource layer as reference, or by simulating individual movements
(central place or free ranging foraging). You can navigate the articles
above detailing each step:

- Simulate a virtual environment
- Simulate a species with spatial point process
- Simulate a species from individual movement
- Simulate an observation survey

The package also includes various functions (`%!in%` and `normalize()`)

## Installation

You can install the development version of simtools following:

``` r
# remotes::install_github("CLambert1/virtualecologist")
```

## Access help and documentation

A dedicated website is available at
<https://CLambert1.github.io/virtualecologist>, or by tipping
`launch_help()` in the console, which will launch the locally installed
html documentation in your web browser.
